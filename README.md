# Snakes-and-Ladders
The board has 100 cells numbered from 1 to 100. The game uses a six-sided die, numbered from 1 to 6, which always gives a random number on rolling. Each player has a piece which is initially kept outside the board (i.e., at position 0). Each player rolls the dice when their turn comes.
